# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict student performance based on various attributes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information such as study time, family background, health, and school-related factors.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts student performance, helping educators identify students in need of additional support.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). It includes features like:
- **Demographic data**: age, gender, family background
- **Academic factors**: study time, previous failures, school support
- **Social factors**: internet access, relationship status

## Models and Techniques

The project employs the following models and techniques:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution, correlation analysis
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Results

The performance of different models is compared, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
